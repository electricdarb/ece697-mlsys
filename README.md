# ece697IL: ML and Systems

 Machine learning is widely employed in a range of applications. This course has two parts. The first part is about ML systems, which will talk about the most recent research in machine learning, such as efficient model training, inference, and serving, distributed and parallel learning algorithms and systems, ML programming models and abstractions. The second part is about ML for systems, where ML is deployed to solve system problems, such as identifying performance, reliability, and scalability issues in both static and dynamic scenarios. This course will review cutting-edge research on these topics and allow students to work on a hands-on project. The course will primarily involve reading, presenting, and discussing papers, and a final project to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

This seminar follows the same structure as [COMPSCI 692S](https://guanh01.github.io/teaching/2020-fall-mlsys) offered by Dr. Hui Guan. It will primarily involve reading, presenting, and discussing recent papers in ML and systems, and a final project focusing on a specific ML system topic (3 credits).

## Grading
- 10% presentation 
- 20% participation: attendence, discussion
- 20% reviews
- 40% course project: presentation (10%), code and report (30%)

**Note:** 
<p> Presentation: Each student will be required to present at least once.
 
<p>Paricipation: you should update the participation record by youself at the end of each class (within 30 minutes of the end of the class). For each class, you will need to record 4 points if you have attended, and record 2 additional points if you have participated the discussion (such as asking and helping answer the question). </p>

<p> Reviews: each will be required to write mandatory reviews for all papers and one summary review. We will introduce the peer review for writing the comments, where all reviews will be anonymous initially and every one could comment others with ``Good Work'' or other negative comments. The one with the most negative comments will be not counted as a qualified review, which could be compensated by writing a new review for the new paper or fix the review for the current paper. Note that all reviews should be submitted before 12/08 to be counted. The instrutor may occasionally grade the reviews.  </p>
