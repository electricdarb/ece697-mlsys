Analyze the different prunning algorithm or quantization 

If w have done something for traditional object detection, then check how we could use it for video tracking. 

check the performance of using different frmaeworks, such as Model deployment is simply the engineering task of exposing an ML model to real use.
such as Onnx, TensorFlow, and Pytorch

Students could use Co-Lab, which is free.  

Try to use machine learning for identifying different types of performance issues, such as NUMA architecture, field reorganization, array grouping.
